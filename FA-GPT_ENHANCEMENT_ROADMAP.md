## Executive Summary

FA-GPT currently serves as a document retrieval and question-answering system for Field Artillery publications. Based on analysis of 75+ military documents including Field Manuals (FMs), Army Training Publications (ATPs), Tabular Firing Tables (TFTs), and technical manuals, this roadmap outlines comprehensive enhancements to transform FA-GPT into a complete military decision support platform.

### Key Document Collections Analyzed:
- **Tabular Firing Tables (TFTs)**: 16 specialized ballistic data tables
- **Field Manuals**: Core doctrine (FM 3-09, FM 6-0, FM 3-0, etc.)
- **Army Training Publications**: Specialized procedures (ATP 3-09.x series)
- **Technical Manuals**: Equipment-specific guides (M109A6, etc.)
- **Army Regulations**: Policy and safety guidance
- **Planning Documents**: MDMP handbooks and decision-making guides

## Core System Improvements

### 1. Advanced Document Processing & Structured Data Extraction

> **⚠️ CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NOTE**: Current analysis reveals that while FA-GPT has Granite Docling integration designed, **Docling is not actually installed** in the environment. The system is falling back to basic PyMuPDF extraction. This section addresses both fixing the current infrastructure and enhancing beyond Docling's capabilities.

#### Current State Analysis (September 2025) - **UPDATED**
**What's Actually Working**:
- ✅ **Docling Dependencies**: Successfully installed (docling 1.9.0, pydantic-settings 2.10.1)
- ✅ **Configuration Fixed**: Updated for new pydantic-settings API with proper path handling
- ⚠️ **Docling Models**: Core dependencies installed, but layout model files need manual download
- ✅ **PyMuPDF Fallback**: Basic PDF text extraction working as backup
- ✅ **CLIP Embeddings**: Multimodal content processing available
- ✅ **Qwen VLM**: Image analysis capabilities (when Ollama running)
- ⚠️ **Table Processing**: Will improve significantly once Docling models are fully operational

**Infrastructure Status**:
- ✅ **Fixed**: Imported correct Docling classes (PipelineOptions, AssembleOptions from base_models)
- ✅ **Fixed**: Updated configuration to handle new pydantic-settings validation
- ✅ **Fixed**: Resolved path issues for local development vs Docker
- ⚠️ **Pending**: Complete model download (layout model missing: beehive_v0.0.5)

**Next Steps for Full Docling Integration**:
1. Download missing layout models: `huggingface_hub.snapshot_download('ds4sd/docling-models')`
2. Verify table extraction quality on TFT documents
3. Compare Docling vs current PyMuPDF extraction results

#### B. Tabular Firing Table (TFT) Specialized Parser
**Current Gap**: Even with Docling, TFTs contain critical ballistic data requiring domain-specific understanding that generic table extraction cannot provide.

**Proposed Solution**: **Complementary Approach** - `tft_parser.py` module working with Docling
**Why Specialized TFT Parser is Still Valuable (Beyond Docling)**:

1. **Domain-Specific Structure Understanding**
```python
# Current Docling: Sees this as a generic table
Range: 1000m | Charge: 1 | Elevation: 312 mils | TOF: 23.4s

# Specialized TFT Parser: Creates structured ballistic data
{
    "range_meters": 1000,
    "charge": "1", 
    "elevation_mils": 312,
    "time_of_flight_seconds": 23.4,
    "projectile_type": "M795_HE",
    "ballistic_coefficient": 0.456
}
```

2. **Mathematical Relationships**: TFTs contain ballistic equations and interpolation rules that generic table extraction cannot understand

3. **Military-Specific Data Validation**: Range/charge combinations, elevation constraints, ammunition compatibility

4. **Real-time Fire Mission Processing**: Direct integration with fire direction calculations

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Phase 1**: Install and test Docling's TFT table extraction quality
- **Phase 2a**: If Docling handles TFTs well → Build semantic layer on top of Docling extraction
- **Phase 2b**: If Docling struggles → Implement hybrid approach (Docling + specialized computer vision)
- **Phase 3**: Add ballistic calculation engine and military domain validation

**Files to Create**:
```
app/parsers/
├── tft_parser.py
├── ballistic_calculator.py
└── firing_data_models.py
```

**Database Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE firing_tables (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    projectile_type VARCHAR(50),
    charge VARCHAR(10),
    range_meters INTEGER,
    elevation_mils INTEGER,
    time_of_flight DECIMAL(5,2),
    drift_mils INTEGER,
    ballistic_coefficient DECIMAL(4,3)
);
```

#### B. Military Forms & Procedures Parser
**Current Gap**: Standard military forms and procedures are buried in text without structured extraction.

**Proposed Solution**: Form-aware extraction system
- **Recognize standard military forms**: Call for Fire, 9-line MEDEVAC, SALUTE reports
- **Extract form fields into structured data**: Enable auto-population and validation
- **Create digital form templates**: Interactive forms with embedded knowledge
- **Procedure step extraction**: Break down complex procedures into actionable steps

**Implementation**:
```python
class MilitaryFormParser:
    def parse_call_for_fire(self, text):
        # Extract 6-line call for fire format
        pass
    
    def parse_medevac_request(self, text):
        # Extract 9-line MEDEVAC format
        pass
    
    def parse_situation_report(self, text):
        # Extract SALUTE format
        pass
```

#### C. Tactical Graphics & Map Symbol Extractor
**Current Gap**: Military symbols and tactical graphics require specialized computer vision.

**Proposed Solution**: Enhanced image processing for military symbols
- **OCR for grid coordinates**: Extract map coordinates and unit designations
- **Symbol recognition**: Identify NATO military symbols using computer vision
- **Tactical overlay understanding**: Parse fire support coordination measures
- **Range card extraction**: Extract firing data from range cards and overlays

---

### 2. Enhanced Knowledge Graph & Relationship Modeling

#### A. Military Hierarchy & Organization Graph
**Current Gap**: Organizational relationships are implicit in documents but not modeled.

**Proposed Solution**: Military-specific knowledge graph
```python
# Neo4j Cypher examples
CREATE (brigade:Unit {name: "1st BCT", type: "Brigade"})
CREATE (battalion:Unit {name: "1-319 FA", type: "Battalion"})
CREATE (brigade)-[:COMMANDS]->(battalion)
```

**Features**:
- **Unit relationships**: Model brigade → battalion → company hierarchy
- **Command structure**: Track command and support relationships

- **Fire mission sequences**: Track fire mission workflow and safety checks
- **Safety procedure dependencies**: Ensure all safety steps are followed
- **Training progressions**: Model prerequisite relationships in training

#### C. Equipment & Systems Knowledge Graph
**Current Gap**: Technical relationships between systems are not modeled.

**Proposed Solution**: Equipment-centric knowledge modeling

- **Maintenance procedures**: Link procedures to specific components
- **Part number cross-references**: Enable parts lookup and compatibility
- **Technical specification matrices**: Compare system capabilities
